# Step 1) define variables
# In the expression, there are in total 4 numbers - 125 / 3 / 5 / 25, so I need to define 4 variables
a = 125
b = 3
c = 5
d = 25

# Step 2) Use the above 4 variables, do the calculation, using the result to define a new variable - answer
answer = a * b + a * c + d * b + d

# Step 3) Use variable answer
print("125 * 3 + 125 * 5 + 25 * 3 + 25 = ", answer)
