Requirement:

You receive a email from NTUC Supermarket CEO Mr Seah.

Good Morning!

It is the end of the year 2020. Time flies! I need you to help develop a program which is to calculate how much bonus we should pay to all our staff
as their end of year bonus. Here is my basic idea:

We need to distribute the total bonus to all our staff based on the supermarket's yearly performance.
We plan to calculate the total bonus using a layered strategy. Specifically:

1) If the supermarket's yearly profit is less than 1 million, then
   i) 10% of the profit will be used as the total bonus.

2) If the supermarket's yearly profit is less than or equals to 2 million, then the total bonus is composed of
   i) 10% of the 1st million profit
   ii) 7.5% of the remaining profit

3) If the supermarket's yearly profit is less than or equals to 4 million, then the total bonus is composed of
   i) 10% of the 1st million profit
   ii) 7.5% of the 2nd million profit
   iii) 5% of the remaining profit

4) If the supermarket's yearly profit is less than or equals to 6 million, then the total bonus is composed of
   i) 10% of the 1st million profit
   ii) 7.5% of the 2nd million profit
   iii) 5% of the 3rd and 4th million profit
   iv) 3% of the remaining profit

5) If the supermarket's yearly profit is less than or equals to 10 million, then the total bonus is composed of
   i) 10% of the 1st million profit
   ii) 7.5% of the 2nd million profit
   iii) 5% of the 3rd and 4th million profit
   iv) 3% of the 5th and 6th million profit
   v) 1.5% of the remaining profit

6) If the supermarket's yearly profit is above 10 million, then the total bonus is composed of
   i) 10% of the 1st million profit
   ii) 7.5% of the 2nd million profit
   iii) 5% of the 3rd and 4th million profit
   iv) 3% of the 5th and 6th million profit
   v) 1.5% of the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th million profit
   vi) 1% of the remaining profit

So when the program starts, I, as the CEO of the supermarket can input the total profit of the year, then you program will
tell me how much bonus I should keep for our staff.

Another thing is, as you know, we have in total 230 outlets in the whole island.
So you program should be able to run repetitively, asking me to input the total profit of some outlet, then tell me the bonus number for that outlet, until I say 'exit'.

This is a critical program as it is related to the money. Please make sure your program can calculate the correct amount.
I trust you can do this job beautifully as a seasoned python programmer.

Good luck!
Mr Seah.

# Step 1) Let's work on a version without loop

profit = int(input("Total profit of the year:"))

bonus = 0

if profit <= 1000000:
    bonus = profit * 0.1

elif profit <= 2000000:
    bonus = 1000000 * 0.1
    bonus += (profit - 1000000) * 0.075

elif profit <= 4000000:
    bonus = 1000000 * 0.1
    bonus += 1000000 * 0.075
    bonus += (profit - 2000000) * 0.05

elif profit <= 6000000:
    bonus = 1000000 * 0.1
    bonus += 1000000 * 0.075
    bonus += 2000000 * 0.05
    bonus += (profit - 4000000) * 0.03

elif profit <= 10000000:
    bonus = 1000000 * 0.1
    bonus += 1000000 * 0.075
    bonus += 2000000 * 0.05
    bonus += 2000000 * 0.03
    bonus += (profit - 6000000) * 0.015

else:
    bonus = 1000000 * 0.1
    bonus += 1000000 * 0.075
    bonus += 2000000 * 0.05
    bonus += 2000000 * 0.03
    bonus += 4000000 * 0.015
    bonus += (profit - 10000000) * 0.01

print(f"We should keep ${bonus} to our staff for this outlet")
