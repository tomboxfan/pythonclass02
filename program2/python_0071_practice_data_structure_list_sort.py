'''
Requirement:
1) Ask user to input number from console
2) Add the number to the list in the correct order, so that the numbers are sorted asscendingly
3) Print list to the console
4) Exit the program when user input 'exit'
'''

# PREPARE DATA BEGIN ---------------------

# step 1) I define a list variable my_list, this is to hold all numbers from user
my_list = []

# Step 2) I need to define a str variable new_number_str, this is to store the number input from console by user
new_number_str = input("Next number: ")


# MAIN PROGRAM BEGIN ---------------------

# Step 3) I loop until new_number_str is 'exit'
while 'exit' != new_number_str:

    # Step 3.1) I conver the str new_number_str to int variable new_number
    new_number = int(new_number_str)


    # Step 3.2) I need to find the correct place where I can insert the new_number into my_list
    # Initially, I set new_number_index to 0, which means I insert new_number at index '0' of my_list
    # Remember: index 0 means the 1st place in my_list
    new_number_index = 0

    # Step 3.3) I loop my_list
    # I increase new_number_index as long as current_number is smaller than new_number.
    # I stop until current_number >= new_number, it means I've found the correct place where I should insert this new_number.
    for current_number in my_list:
        if current_number < new_number:
            new_number_index += 1
        else:
            break

    # Step 3.4) Insert new_number to my_list at place - new_number_index
    my_list.insert(new_number_index, new_number)
    print(my_list)

    # Step 3.5) Update loop condition: Read next number from user
    new_number_str = input("Next number: ")
